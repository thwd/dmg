##### Simple and Fast (Generalized) Parsing for Go

Package `dmg` (pronounced ["demagogue"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue)) is a parser combinator library for the Go programming language. It is fast, has full support for left-recursive and right-nullable grammars and stands out for its simplicity in design.

Full documentation can be found on http://godoc.org/github.com/thwd/dmg.

It's not quite ready for prime-time yet but it works, and works well so far. There will be more added features in the near future. I'm working on finishing a stable API and will promote it to beta then.

**This project contains some original research of mine**, obviously built upon the work others. Full bibliography and credits to follow.
