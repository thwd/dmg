##### Simple and Fast (Generalized) Parsing for Go

Package `dmg` (pronounced as ["demagogue"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue)) is a parser combinator library for the Go programming language. It is fast, has full support for left-recursive and right-nullable grammars and stands out for its simplicity in design.

 * **It is work in progress** and can be considered to be in a pre-alpha stadium.
 * **It is my original research**, obviously built upon the work others. Full bibliography and credits to follow soon.
 * **It is (still) undocumented** but that should change soon.
